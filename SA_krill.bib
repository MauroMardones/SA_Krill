abstract = {Climate change is projected to cause significant alterations to aquatic biogeochemical processes, (including carbon dynamics), aquatic food web structure, dynamics and biodiversity, primary and secondary production; and, affect the range, distribution and habitat quality/quantity of aquatic mammals and waterfowl. Projected enhanced permafrost thawing is very likely to increase nutrient, sediment, and carbon loadings to aquatic systems, resulting in both positive and negative effects on freshwater chemistry. Nutrient and carbon enrichment will enhance nutrient cycling and productivity, and alter the generation and consumption of carbon-based trace gases. Consequently, the status of aquatic ecosystems as carbon sinks or sources is very likely to change. Climate change will also very likely affect the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems across most of the Arctic. The magnitude, extent, and duration of the impacts and responses will be system- and location-dependent. Projected effects on aquatic mammals and waterfowl include altered migration routes and timing; a possible increase in the incidence of mortality and decreased growth and productivity from disease and/or parasites; and, probable changes in habitat suitability and timing of availability.},

abstract = {The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery is the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean, and it has been operating for over 45 years. In the past decade, the spatial distribution of the krill fishery has focused on the Bransfield Strait off the Antarctic Peninsula (subarea 48.1). However, the high fishing effort and climate change have placed great pressure on krill resources in this region, and conservation concerns have been raised. Because aging krill is difficult and uncertain, we developed an integrated size-structured model to estimate the fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning biomass of krill. The results indicated that in 1992–2011, the average spawning biomass of krill ranged from 1.14 × 106 to 1.45 × 106 tons, the estimated biomass of the maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) ranged from 3.96 × 105 to 4.90 × 105 tons and the estimated average recruitment ranged from 2.3 × 1012 to 5.03 × 1012 individuals in the research area. We explored the effect of different data weighting schemes for the length data on the assessment output. However, our estimates also have uncertainties. In addition, an attempt was made to analyze the correlation between model-estimated recruitment and mature biomass with climate change. Future stock assessments of krill resources should be comprehensive and multimethod, and the management of krill resources should be based on science that considers the demand of fishing communities and ecosystem protection.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, have a circumpolar distribution but are concentrated within the south-west Atlantic sector, where they support a unique food web and a commercial fishery. Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether “hotspots” of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976–2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem.},

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {A variety of data types can be included in contemporary integrated stock assessments to simultaneously provide information on all estimated parameters. Conflicts between data, which are often a symptom of model misspecification and evident as model misfit, can affect the estimates of important parameters and derived quantities. Unfortunately, there are few standard diagnostic tools available for integrated stock assessment models that can provide the analyst with all the information needed to determine if there is substantial model misspecification. In this study, we use simulation methods to evaluate the ability of commonly-used and recently-proposed diagnostic tests to detect model misspecification in the observation model process (i.e., the incorrect form for survey selectivity), systems dynamics (i.e., incorrect assumed values for steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship and natural mortality), and incorrect data weighting. The diagnostic tests evaluated here were: i) residuals analysis (SDNR and runs test); ii) retrospective analysis; iii) the R0 likelihood component profile; iv) the age-structured production model (ASPM); and v) catch-curve analysis (CCA). The efficacy of the diagnostic tests depended on whether the misspecification was in the observation or systems dynamics model. Residual analyses were easily the best detector of misspecification of the observation model while the ASPM test was the only good diagnostic for detecting misspecification of system dynamics model. Retrospective analysis and the R0 likelihood component profile infrequently detected misspecified models, and CCA had a high probability of rejecting correctly-specified models. Finally, applying multiple carefully selected diagnostics can increase the power to detect misspecification without substantially increasing the probability of falsely concluding there is misspecification when the model is correctly specified.},

abstract = {Integrated stock assessments consist of fitting several sources of catch, abundance, and auxiliary biological information to estimate parameters of equations that describe the population dynamics of fish stocks. Stock assessments are subject to uncertainty, and it is a common practice to characterize uncertainty using alternative hypotheses and assumptions within an ensemble of models to develop scientific advice for fisheries management. In this context, there is the need to assign levels of plausibility to each of the combinations of factors that ultimately reflect the uncertainty on different biological and fishery processes. In this study, we describe and apply a model diagnostic to identify trends in process error in recruitment deviation estimates within ensembles of integrated assessment models of tropical tunas. We demonstrate that assessment model ensembles for tropical tunas contain distinct scenarios with significant trends in process error that are overlooked, with the associated implications for fisheries management. Using the Indian Ocean yellowfin as a case study, we found that trends in recruitment deviates are linked to extreme productivity scenarios which strongly diverged in scale from deterministic models fitted without recruitment deviates. This indicates that when recruitment deviates show an increasing trend, these can compensate for the loss of biomass in periods of high catch beyond the surplus production. In these cases, variation in recruitment is not a random process, but rather takes the function of a compensatory, systematic driver in productivity. Significant trends in recruitment were positively correlated with increased standard deviations and auto-correlation coefficient, non-random residual pattern in fits to abundance indices, and particularly poor performance of the Age-Structured Production Model (ASPM) diagnostic. We suggest that trends in recruitment deviates can be caused by misspecification of the biological parameters used as fixed values in integrated assessment models. The process error diagnostic described here can provide a statistical criterion in support for hypotheses and assumptions when using ensembles of models to develop fisheries management advice.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis has increasingly been the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks around the world. Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next generation of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.},

abstract = {The ‘stock concept' in fisheries science conforms to theoretical assumptions of stock assessment models, including negligible movement across stock boundaries, relatively homogeneous vital rates, and extensive mixing within stock areas. Best practices for representing population structure in stock assessment involve 1) interdisciplinary stock identification to delineate spatially discrete populations or more complex population structure; 2) stock boundaries that are aligned with the most plausible population structure; 3) spatially-explicit sampling, fleet structure or spatial structure in assessment models to account for heterogeneity, fishing patterns, and movement within stock areas; 4) routine stock composition sampling and analysis for spatially overlapping populations; and 5) simulation testing the performance of assessments with mis-specified or uncertain population structure. Practical assessment units that do not accurately represent population structure may not provide sufficient information to achieve fishery management objectives, so practical constraints should be addressed through iterative advances in routine stock identification, delineation of stocks to meet unit-stock assumptions, and stock assessment modeling.},

We generated a virtual ecosystem, using a spatial automaton-geographic information system technique, to study management scenarios. We used literature data to generate the advection field, the initial krill biomass, and the distribution and size of penguin colonies in the area. Parameters for the fishing fleet were extracted from analysis of Chilean krill-fishing vessels. The model assumes that krill are passive current drifters and that penguin foraging occurs in areas close to their colonies. We analyzed the effect that a simulated 20-vessel fishing fleet would have on the availability of prey, considering the krill flux due to advection. The results show that it would be reasonable to manage the krill fishery in the South Shetland Islands as an interconnected set of ecotrophic modules, allocating the fleet downstream from the main penguin foraging sector.},

abstract = {The time-series of acoustically surveyed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) biomass near the South Shetland Islands (SSI) between 1996 and 2006 is re-estimated using a validated physics-based model of target strength (TS), and a species-discrimination algorithm based on the length-range of krill in plankton samples to identify krill acoustically, derived from TS-model predictions. The SSI area is surveyed each austral summer by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program, and the acoustic data are used to examine trends in krill biomass and to assess the potential impact of fishing to the reproductive success of land-based predators (seals and penguins). The time-series of recomputed biomass densities varies greatly from that computed using an empirical log-linear TS-model and fixed-ranges of differences in volume-backscattering strengths ($\Delta$Sv), conventionally used to identify krill acoustically. The new acoustic estimates of biomass are significantly correlated with both proportional recruitment and krill abundance estimated from zooplankton samples. Two distinct peaks in biomass (1996 and 2003) are in accord with recruitment events shown by net-based krill time-series. The foundation for the new TS-model and the associated krill-discrimination algorithm, coupled with the agreement between acoustic- and net-survey results, provides strong support for the use of the new analytical technique. Variable biases in the re-estimated krill biomass have been greatly reduced. However, survey variability increased as a result of the increased rejection of acoustic backscatter previously attributed to krill. Management of Southern Ocean krill stocks based on a precautionary approach may therefore result in decreased allocations of krill, given its dependence on the variability of survey estimates. {\textcopyright} 2008 US Government and the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service/Southwest Fisheries Science Center.},

Importantly, this study addresses potential biases in commercial effort data and establishes the usefulness of commercial bottom-trawl gear as a suitable method for sampling and evaluating southern horse mackerel stock dynamics. Ordered regression models were applied to allow for the modelling of the distribution of multiple age categories and investigate spatio-temporal migrations off the Portuguese coast. Southern horse mackerel show a widespread age distribution range and stable abundance with indications of seasonal and spatial patterns in the distribution of specific age groups.

abstract = {Integrated stock assessments consist of fitting several sources of catch, abundance, and auxiliary biological information to estimate parameters of equations that describe the population dynamics of fish stocks. Stock assessments are subject to uncertainty, and it is a common practice to characterize uncertainty using alternative hypotheses and assumptions within an ensemble of models to develop scientific advice for fisheries management. In this context, there is the need to assign levels of plausibility to each of the combinations of factors that ultimately reflect the uncertainty on different biological and fishery processes. In this study, we describe and apply a model diagnostic to identify trends in process error in recruitment deviation estimates within ensembles of integrated assessment models of tropical tunas. We demonstrate that assessment model ensembles for tropical tunas contain distinct scenarios with significant trends in process error that are overlooked, with the associated implications for fisheries management. Using the Indian Ocean yellowfin as a case study, we found that trends in recruitment deviates are linked to extreme productivity scenarios which strongly diverged in scale from deterministic models fitted without recruitment deviates. This indicates that when recruitment deviates show an increasing trend, these can compensate for the loss of biomass in periods of high catch beyond the surplus production. In these cases, variation in recruitment is not a random process, but rather takes the function of a compensatory, systematic driver in productivity. Significant trends in recruitment were positively correlated with increased standard deviations and auto-correlation coefficient, non-random residual pattern in fits to abundance indices, and particularly poor performance of the Age-Structured Production Model (ASPM) diagnostic. We suggest that trends in recruitment deviates can be caused by misspecification of the biological parameters used as fixed values in integrated assessment models. The process error diagnostic described here can provide a statistical criterion in support for hypotheses and assumptions when using ensembles of models to develop fisheries management advice.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species of the Southern Ocean, impacted by climate change and human exploitation. Understanding how these changes affect the distribution and abundance of krill is crucial for generating projections of change for Southern Ocean ecosystems. Krill growth is an important indicator of habitat suitability and a series of models have been developed and used to examine krill growth potential at different spatial and temporal scales. The available models have been developed using a range of empirical and mechanistic approaches, providing alternative perspectives and comparative analyses of the key processes influencing krill growth. Here we undertake an intercomparison of a suite of the available models to understand their sensitivities to major driving variables. This illustrates that the results are strongly determined by the model structure and technical characteristics, and the data on which they were developed and validated. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the constraints and requirements of individual krill growth models to ensure their appropriate application. The study also demonstrates the value of the development of alternative modelling approaches to identify key processes affecting the dynamics of krill. Of critical importance for modelling the growth of krill is appropriately assessing and accounting for differences in estimates of food availability resulting from alternative methods of observation. We suggest that an intercomparison approach is particularly valuable in the development and application of models for the assessment of krill growth potential at circumpolar scales and for future projections. As another result of the intercomparison, the implementations of the models used in this study are now publicly available for future use and analyses.},

Identifying drivers of krill biomass is therefore essential for determining catch limits and designating protection zones. We present a modeling approach to pinpointing effects of sea surface temperature, ice cover, chlorophyll levels, climate indices, and intraspecific competition. Our study reveals that larval recruitment is driven by both competition among age classes and chlorophyll levels. In addition, while milder ice and temperature in spring and summer favor reproduction and early larval survival, both larvae and juveniles strongly benefit from heavier ice and colder temperatures in winter. We conclude that omitting top-down control of resources by krill is only acceptable for retrospective or single-year prognostic models that use field chlorophyll data but that incorporating intraspecific competition is essential for longer-term forecasts. Our findings can guide future krill modeling strategies, reinforcing the sustainability of this keystone species.},

abstract = {Robust prediction of population responses to changing environments requires the integration of factors controlling population dynamics with processes affecting distribution. This is true everywhere but especially in polar pelagic environments. Biological cycles for many polar species are synchronised to extreme seasonality, while their distributions may be influenced by both the prevailing oceanic circulation and sea-ice distribution. Antarctic krill (krill, Euphausia superba) is one such species exhibiting a complex life history that is finely tuned to the extreme seasonality of the Southern Ocean. Dependencies on the timing of optimal seasonal conditions have led to concerns over the effects of future climate on krill's population status, particularly given the species' important role within Southern Ocean ecosystems. Under a changing climate, established correlations between environment and species may breakdown. Developing the capacity for predicting krill responses to climate change therefore requires methods that can explicitly consider the interplay between life history, biological conditions, and transport. The Spatial Ecosystem And Population Dynamics Model (SEAPODYM) is one such framework that integrates population and general circulation modelling to simulate the spatial dynamics of key organisms. Here, we describe a modification to SEAPODYM, creating a novel model – KRILLPODYM – that generates spatially resolved estimates of krill biomass and demographics. This new model consists of three major components: (1) an age-structured population consisting of five key life stages, each with multiple age classes, which undergo age-dependent growth and mortality, (2) six key habitats that mediate the production of larvae and life stage survival, and (3) spatial dynamics driven by both the underlying circulation of ocean currents and advection of sea-ice. We present the first results of KRILLPODYM, using published deterministic functions of population processes and habitat suitability rules. Initialising from a non-informative uniform density across the Southern Ocean our model independently develops a circumpolar population distribution of krill that approximates observations. The model framework lends itself to applied experiments aimed at resolving key population parameters, life-stage specific habitat requirements, and dominant transport regimes, ultimately informing sustainable fishery management.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a key species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and has important ecological value. It is also one of the main fishery resources in the Southern Ocean with high economic value. In recent years, with the development of krill fishery and rapid climate change, the conservation and management of krill resources have faced unprecedented challenges. The krill resource is different from the general fishery resources. Due to the krill schooling characteristics, fishery data has some advantages over scientific survey data. Reviewing and analyzing the krill fishery data is necessary. Therefore, in this study, four fishery resource indices (FRIs) were calculated based on Antarctic krill fishery data, and based on the environmental dependence of Antarctic krill, the FRI with the strongest environmental dependence was screened by using the Gradient Forest Model, and the step changes of the FRI with strongest environmental dependence was examined by using the sequential t-test analyses of regime shifts (STARS). The generalized additive model (GAM) to analyze the correlation between the FRI with the strongest environmental dependence and the main environmental factors, and then explore the resource status of Antarctic krill in the study area. The model results showed that the “FRI{\_}hual” had the strongest environmental dependence and was a better indicator of the status of the Antarctic krill in the study area than the others. In the 2009–2010 year, “FRI{\_}hual” had an obvious regime shift. The interaction of environmental factors “ice{\_}area{\_}2” and “SSH{\_}1” has a great impact on “FRI{\_}hual”. Methods used and results obtained in the study can provide new ideas and a scientific reference for future work, including integrated stock assessment of krill and krill resource monitoring, conservation, and management based on the ecosystem.},

abstract = {After the Scientific Committee did not reach consensus and advise the Commission on the risks associated with three options for a Stage-1 allocation of the precautionary krill catch limit among SSMUs in Subareas 48.1-48.3, it was suggested that a comprehensive assessment of the risks that might be incurred by not deciding on such an allocation (i.e., a risk assessment of status quo management) be undertaken. We used the same methods applied by the WG-EMM in 2008, including averaging results provided from multiple parameterizations of the same model, and present such a risk assessment here. Our results demonstrate that i) status quo management may jeopardize the Commission's ability to achieve the objectives specified in Article II, and ii) the current trigger level is not as precautionary as previously presumed. Our work also reiterates the advice that the WG-EMM delivered to the Scientific Committee during 2008, and the caveats associated with that previous advice also apply here. Given the risks of status quo management, we identify three approaches by which the Commission can manage risks to krill-dependent predators in a precautionary manner: i) cap krill catches at recent levels until a feedback approach to management of the krill fishery can be implemented; ii) agree a new trigger level, that is less than the current trigger level, while continuing work to evaluate options for a Stage-1 allocation and feedback management strategies; or iii) eliminate the current trigger level, agree a Stage-1 allocation, and focus research to design and evaluate a feedback management strategy. We feel that the collective body of scientific work to advise on issues related to the SSMU allocation has met the "burden of proof" that would be required for decision making.

abstract = {The ‘stock concept' in fisheries science conforms to theoretical assumptions of stock assessment models, including negligible movement across stock boundaries, relatively homogeneous vital rates, and extensive mixing within stock areas. Best practices for representing population structure in stock assessment involve 1) interdisciplinary stock identification to delineate spatially discrete populations or more complex population structure; 2) stock boundaries that are aligned with the most plausible population structure; 3) spatially-explicit sampling, fleet structure or spatial structure in assessment models to account for heterogeneity, fishing patterns, and movement within stock areas; 4) routine stock composition sampling and analysis for spatially overlapping populations; and 5) simulation testing the performance of assessments with mis-specified or uncertain population structure. Practical assessment units that do not accurately represent population structure may not provide sufficient information to achieve fishery management objectives, so practical constraints should be addressed through iterative advances in routine stock identification, delineation of stocks to meet unit-stock assumptions, and stock assessment modeling.},

abstract = {Decision-makers charged with implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) rely on scientists to predict the consequences of decisions relating to multiple, potentially conflicting, objectives. Such predictions are inherently uncertain, and this can be a barrier to decision-making. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources requires managers of Southern Ocean fisheries to sustain the productivity of target stocks, the health and resilience of the ecosystem, and the performance of the fisheries themselves. The managers of the Antarctic krill fishery in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage have requested advice on candidate management measures consisting of a regional catch limit and options for subdividing this among smaller areas. We developed a spatially resolved model that simulates krill-predator-fishery interactions and reproduces a plausible representation of past dynamics. We worked with experts and stakeholders to identify (1) key uncertainties affecting our ability to predict ecosystem state; (2) illustrative reference points that represent the management objectives; and (3) a clear and simple way of conveying our results to decision-makers. We developed four scenarios that bracket the key uncertainties and evaluated candidate management measures in each of these scenarios using multiple stochastic simulations. The model emphasizes uncertainty and simulates multiple ecosystem components relating to diverse objectives. We summarize the potentially complex results as estimates of the risk that each illustrative objective will not be achieved (i.e., of the state being outside the range specified by the reference point). This approach allows direct comparisons between objectives. It also demonstrates that a candid appraisal of uncertainty, in the form of risk estimates, can be an aid, rather than a barrier, to understanding and using ecosystem model predictions. Management measures that reduce coastal fishing, relative to oceanic fishing, apparently reduce risks to both the fishery and the ecosystem. However, alternative reference points could alter the perceived risks, so further stakeholder involvement is needed to identify risk metrics that appropriately represent their objectives. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The Reference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research (READER) project data set of monthly mean Antarctic near-surface temperature, mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) and wind speed has been used to investigate trends in these quantities over the last 50 years for 19 stations with long records. Eleven of these had warming trends and seven had cooling trends in their annual data (one station had too little data to allow an annual trend to be computed), indicating the spatial complexity of change that has occurred across the Antarctic in recent decades. The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a major warming over the last 50 years, with temperatures at Faraday/Vernadsky station having increased at a rate of 0.56°C decade-1 over the year and 1.09°C decade-1 during the winter; both figures are statistically significant at less than the 5{\%} level. Overlapping 30 year trends of annual mean temperatures indicate that, at all but two of the 10 coastal stations for which trends could be computed back to 1961, the warming trend was greater (or the cooling trend less) during the 1961-90 period compared with 1971-2000. All the continental stations for which MSLP data were available show negative trends in the annual mean pressures over the full length of their records, which we attribute to the trend in recent decades towards the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) being in its high-index state. Except for Halley, where the trends are constant, the MSLP trends for all stations on the Antarctic continent for 1971-2000 were more negative than for 1961-90. All but two of the coastal stations have recorded increasing mean wind speeds over recent decades, which is also consistent with the change in the nature of the SAM.

abstract = {The manuscript assesses the current and expected future global drivers of Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystems. Atmospheric ozone depletion over the Antarctic since the 1970s, has been a key driver, resulting in springtime cooling of the stratosphere and intensification of the polar vortex, increasing the frequency of positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). This increases warm air-flow over the East Pacific sector (Western Antarctic Peninsula) and cold air flow over the West Pacific sector. SAM as well as El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation events also affect the Amundsen Sea Low leading to either positive or negative sea ice anomalies in the west and east Pacific sectors, respectively. The strengthening of westerly winds is also linked to shoaling of deep warmer water onto the continental shelves, particularly in the East Pacific and Atlantic sectors. Air and ocean warming has led to changes in the cryosphere, with glacial and ice sheet melting in both sectors, opening up new ice free areas to biological productivity, but increasing seafloor disturbance by icebergs. The increased melting is correlated with a salinity decrease particularly in the surface 100 m. Such processes could increase the availability of iron, which is currently limiting primary production over much of the SO. Increasing CO2 is one of the most important SO anthropogenic drivers and is likely to affect marine ecosystems in the coming decades. While levels of many pollutants are lower than elsewhere, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and plastics have been detected in the SO, with concentrations likely enhanced by migratory species. With increased marine traffic and weakening of ocean barriers the risk of the establishment of non-indigenous species is increased. The continued recovery of the ozone hole creates uncertainty over the reversal in sea ice trends, especially in the light of the abrupt transition from record high to record low Antarctic sea ice extent since spring 2016. The current rate of change in physical and anthropogenic drivers is certain to impact the Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean (MEASO) region in the near future and will have a wide range of impacts across the marine ecosystem.},

abstract = { Antarctic krill Euphausia superba , a keystone species in the Southern Ocean, is highly relevant for studying effects of climate-related shifts on management systems. Krill provides a key link between primary producers and higher trophic levels and supports the largest regional fishery. Any major perturbation in the krill population would have severe ecological and economic ramifications. We review the literature to determine how climate change, in concert with other environmental changes, alters krill habitat, affects spatial distribution/abundance, and impacts fisheries management. Findings recently reported on the effects of climate change on krill distribution and abundance are inconsistent, however, raising questions regarding methods used to detect changes in density and biomass. One recent study reported a sharp decline in krill densities near their northern limit, accompanied by a poleward contraction in distribution in the Southwest Atlantic sector. Another recent study found no evidence of long-term decline in krill density or biomass and reported no evidence of a poleward shift in distribution. Moreover, with predicted decreases in phytoplankton production, vertical foraging migrations to the seabed may become more frequent, also impacting krill production and harvesting. Potentially cumulative impacts of climate change further compound the management challenge faced by CCAMLR, the organization responsible for conservation of Antarctic marine living resources: to detect changes in the abundance, distribution, and reproductive performance of krill and krill-dependent predator stocks and to respond to such change by adjusting its conservation measures. Based on CCAMLR reports and documents, we review the institutional framework, outline how climate change has been addressed within this organization, and examine the prospects for further advances toward ecosystem risk assessment and an adaptive management system. },

abstract = {High-latitude ecosystems are among the fastest warming on the planet1. Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting2–4. Here, we show that, within their main population centre in the southwest Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba (hereafter, ‘krill') has contracted southward over the past 90 years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have declined sharply and the population has become more concentrated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruitment, including a reduced density of juveniles following positive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and the survival of larval krill5. However, the total post-larval density has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, suggesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred food web6 and may affect biogeochemical cycling7,8. Rapid climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems3.},

abstract = {This paper explains the management of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, and current knowledge about the state of the regional krill stock. In this region, krill fishing is permitted in an area of approximately 3.5 million km2 which is divided into four subareas (labelled Subareas 48.1 to 48.4) for management and reporting purposes. The effective regional catch limit (or ‘trigger level'), established in 1991, is 0.62 million tonnes year–1, equivalent to {\~{}}1{\%} of the regional biomass estimated in 2000. Each subarea has also had its own catch limit, between 0.093 and 0.279 million tonnes year–1, since 2009. There is some evidence for a decline in the abundance of krill in the 1980s, but no evidence of a further decline in recent decades. Local-scale monitoring programs have been established in three of the subareas to monitor krill biomass in survey grids covering between 10 000 and 125 000 km2. Cautious extrapolation from these local monitoring programs provides conservative estimates of the regional biomass in recent years. This suggests that fishing at the trigger level would be equivalent to a long-term exploitation rate (annual catch divided by biomass) of {\textless}7{\%}, which is below the 9.3{\%} level considered appropriate to maintain the krill stock and support krill predators. Subarea catch limits exceed 9.3{\%} of conservatively estimated subarea biomass in up to 20{\%} of years due to high variability in krill biomass indices. The actual exploitation rate in each subarea has remained {\textless}3{\%} because annual catches have been {\textless}50{\%} of the trigger level since 1991. Comparison with the 9.3{\%} reference exploitation rate suggests that current management is precautionary at the regional scale. The subarea catch limits help prevent excessive concentration of catch at the subarea scale. Finer-scale management might be necessary to manage the risk of adverse impacts which might occur as a result of concentrated fishing in sensitive areas or climate change. Frequent assessment of the krill stock will enhance CCAMLR's ability to manage these risks. Continuing the local monitoring programs will provide valuable information on krill variability, but more information is required on how the monitored biomass relates to biomass at the subarea and regional scales.},

abstract = {An integrated, age-structured model was fitted to different combinations of survey data using two forms of selectivity (logistic or double-logistic) with time-constant or annually varying selectivity to investigate the population dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) near the Antarctic Peninsula. The data were from surveys conducted by the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program around the South Shetland Islands from 1992 to 2011. Two indices of krill biomass based on (1) trawl-net samples and (2) hydroacoustic sampling were combined with length-compositions from the nets. Sixteen model configurations using different combinations of the two biomass surveys with the various options for modeling selectivities were examined. Parameters were estimated in phases with the sequential order of the phases randomized until an invertible Hessian matrix was obtained. Model consistency for the estimates of derived quantities was tested using simulated data. Annual trends in the estimates of total biomass, spawning biomass, and recruitment were similar among different configurations assuming time-constant selectivity, but the absolute scaling ranged widely depending on which biomass indices were used. All configurations with time-constant selectivities were able to reproduce the derived quantities of the operating model when fitted to simulated data. Annually varying selectivities produced more variable estimates of the trends in population biomass, but less variable estimates of scale, compared to time-constant configurations fitted to the same data. The models with annually varying selectivities did not produce invertible Hessian matrices, and four of these configurations could not reproduce the derived parameters of their operating model when fitted to simulated data. Using AIC, the model with logistic, time-constant selectivities was selected as the best configuration to fit both sources of biomass data. The two-stage approach of first randomizing the phase order until an invertible Hessian matrix is achieved and then verifying the reproducibility of the estimates of derived quantities using simulated data could be employed in any integrated stock assessment with parameters estimated in phases.},

abstract = {Three alternative forms of the spawner-recruit relationship – the Beverton-Holt and two expressions of the Ricker function - and a fourth form representing annual recruitment deviations without an explicit relationship to spawning biomass, were applied in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill. Model data were from the international krill fishery and U.S. AMLR surveys in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subarea 48.1, the area around the Antarctic peninsula where the majority of recent fishing for krill has taken place. Sensitivity tests using pre-specified values for the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual recruitment residuals ($\sigma$R) and productivity (steepness, h) for the relationship between spawning biomass and subsequent recruitment indicated that neither the Beverton-Holt nor Ricker functions were superior to configurations of the model that did not assume a spawner-recruit relationship. As the predictive power of the spawner-recruit functions was reduced by increasing the value of $\sigma$R the fit to the data improved. All the functions fitted the data best when $\sigma$R was large enough so that random recruitment with respect to spawning biomass was produced. The alternative functions produced the same time series of recruitment and spawning biomass estimates when they were determined by the data rather than forced towards an assumed relationship. Although the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models were poor predictors of the data, cross-correlations of the recruitment predictions with the spawning biomass predictions from the best models indicated that recruitment was statistically correlated with spawning biomasses in the previous two to four years. The highest correlation (0.58) was with spawning biomass three years previously. Correlations in the reverse direction, with spawning biomass following recruitment were insignificant. These results suggest that recruitment variability does not influence subsequent spawning biomass in krill. They leave open the possibility that krill spawning biomass could influence subsequent recruitment, but not as modeled in the Beverton-Holt or Ricker functions with a one-year lag and the pre-specified von Bertalanffy growth.},

abstract = {The performance of a production-model management procedure (the combination of a Schaefer surplus-production function observation-error estimator and the f0.1harvesting strategy) is evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Several factors which impact the performance of a management procedure (initial depletion, historic catch trajectory, extent of recruitment variability, level of noise about the abundance index, and values for other population model parameters) are considered. The best performance, in terms of conservation and moving the population to its target biomass level, is achieved when recruitment variability, the noise about the abundance index and natural mortality are low, and productivity is high. Performance, in terms of conservation, is poor if management commences from a virtually unexploited state due to the possibility that the estimator overestimates the size of the biomass. In this situation, performance is improved by restricting the extent of inter-annual change in catch, although the improvement is at the expense of lesser recovery of overexploited resources and lesser utilization of resources which are initially virtually pristine. The results of this paper can be used as part of an evaluation of whether a production model can be used in the management of a particular resource. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

For this, the time-series of fresh fish landed in the 1973–2009 period is analysed through an estimation of the series of transfer function models. Among other things, the findings in the Spanish case show a complex relationship between the amount of fish landed and price; a clear substitution relationship between fresh fish and aquaculture; a negative impact oflabour costs in amanual labour-inten- sive sector such as fishing, which in developed countries is being affected by an exodus of manpower to other sectors where there is less uncertainty surrounding labour conditions; the impact ofSpain being barred from international fishing grounds a result ofthe delimitation of exclusive economic zones (EEZs); and the dwindling importance of fisheries traffic as a result of the port devolution process begun in Spain in the early 1990s. Thenon-significance ofa priori key factors, such as the price ofoil andSpain's entry into the EEC, canbe explainedby widespread energy subsidies and contradictions in the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, respectively},

abstract = {In Antarctica, abundant consumers rely on Antarctic krill for food, but krill are also the subject of a commercial fishery. The fishery overlaps in time and space with the foraging areas of these consumers, thus potential competition between krill fisheries and krill consumers is a major management concern. The fishery is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources with an ecosystem approach, according to which fishing should not interfere with either the population growth of krill, or krill-dependent consumers. Krill catches have become increasingly spatially concentrated in a small number of hotspots, raising concerns about how local depletion of krill impacts consumers. Such concentrated fishing demonstrates that there is a mismatch between the spatial and temporal scale at which krill fisheries are currently managed, and that at which fisheries operate and consumers forage. Information on the seasonal dynamics of predator abundance and their foraging behaviour is fundamental to future precautionary management of the krill fishery. We analysed the spatiotemporal distribution of two major krill consumers – humpback and minke whales – and that of krill fishing, off the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We used whale tracking data (58 humpback whale tracks and 19 minke whale tracks) to develop spatial random forest models predicting the monthly distribution of whale foraging areas from January-July. Using these predictions, we calculated spatiotemporally-explicit geographic overlap between whales and fisheries, the latter represented by krill fishing effort and catch data. Over the krill fishing season, fishing effort and catch hotspots shifted to the southwest, into the Bransfield Strait where effort and catch was highest. Predicted humpback whale foraging areas increased in the Bransfield Strait over the same period, while predicted minke whale foraging areas showed an opposite trend. For both we predicted a whale-fishing interaction hotspot in the Bransfield Strait, strongest in April and May. Our results illustrate the fine spatial scale of likely interactions between baleen whales and the krill fishery, and their concentration over the season, underlining the need for fishery management more closely aligned to the spatiotemporal scale of likely predator-fishery interactions.},

abstract = {Understanding how predator foraging behaviour is influenced by the distribution and abundance of prey is a fundamental challenge in marine foraging ecology. This is particularly relevant in Southern Ocean ecosystems where the relationships between select predator species and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) can inform ecosystem conservation and precautionary fisheries management. In this study, we examine the spatial associations between krill swarm characteristics and Ad{\'{e}}lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) foraging effort at B{\'{e}}chervaise Island, a long-term monitoring site in East Antarctica. Spatially integrating two years of regional-scale krill acoustic data with contemporaneous horizontal and vertical movement information from chick-rearing adult Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins, we assessed how penguin foraging effort changed in relation to krill swarm abundance and distribution across the survey area. Our findings show that penguin diving effort was focused in areas with a high number of krill swarms, yet they did not focus their effort in areas with high krill biomass. These results suggest the spatial organisation of Ad{\'{e}}lie penguin foraging effort can provide an indication of krill presence (and/or availability) but may not reflect krill abundance. We discuss our results in the context of penguin foraging strategies, capturing single krill within the water column rather than the engulfment feeding strategy of larger marine mammals such as whales. Our work substantially improves understanding of penguin-krill dynamics in East Antarctica and provides a greater level of nuance regarding the utility of Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins as indicator species under CCAMLR's Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP). Understanding these predator-prey linkages will become increasingly important for managing any expanding krill fisheries in the region or changes in the prey field under future climate change scenarios. Thus, our results can be interpreted alongside other ecological indicators to support management of the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are considered a keystone species for higher trophic level predators along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the austral summer. The connectivity of krill may play a critical role in predator biogeography, especially for central-place foragers such as the Pygoscelis spp. penguins that breed along the WAP during the austral summer. Antarctic krill are also heavily fished commercially; therefore, understanding population connectivity of krill is critical to effective management. Here, we used a physical ocean model to examine adult krill connectivity in this region using simulated krill with realistic diel vertical migration behaviors across four austral summers. Our results indicate that krill north and south of Low Island and the southern Bransfield Strait are nearly isolated from each other and that persistent current features play a role in this lack of inter-region connectivity. Transit and entrainment times were not correlated with penguin populations at the large spatial scales examined. However, long transit times and reduced entrainment correlate spatially with the areas where krill fishing is most intense, which heightens the risk that krill fishing may lead to limited krill availability for predators.},

We tested that assumption by crossing data on fishing activities and Southern Annular Mode (an indicator of climate change in Antarctica) with penguin population data. Increases in fishing catch during the non-breeding period were likely to result in impacts on both chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) populations. Catches and climate change together elevated the probability of negative population growth rates: very high fishing catch on years with warm winters and low sea ice (associated with negative Southern Annular Mode values) implied a decrease in population size in the following year. The current management of krill fishery in the Southern Ocean takes into account an arbitrary and fixed catch limit that does not reflect the variability of the krill population under effects of climate change, therefore affecting penguin populations when the environmental conditions were not favorable.},

abstract = {Total biomass and areal biomass density are often necessary to establish ecological relationships and enable informed management decisions, in particular setting fisheries catch limits. Further refining these estimates to sub-population biomass based on length informs ecological models of predator-prey dynamics, ecosystem energy transfer and biogeochemical cycles; however, measures of uncertainty in these per-length biomass estimates are needed. We present a statistical method to calculate the per-length biomass of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from conversion factors using acoustic and net sample data. Variability in krill length-frequency, and wetmass introduced by net sampling is also explored through non-parametric bootstrapping. We applied this method on a 1 mm length window to active acoustic and net sample data collected during an Antarctic krill biomass survey in CCAMLR Division 58.4.2 (62 – 67°S; 55 – 80°E, with a survey area of 775,732 km2) performed between February – March 2021. We found that 77{\%} of the total estimated biomass was attributable to krill of length 14 – 49 mm. The largest biomass of krill in a single length bin was estimated as 340,000 t (95{\%} CI: 148,000 - 408,000 t) and was found in the 49 mm length bin (i.e., 48.5 to 49.5 mm). This method will allow future surveys (with sufficient data) to estimate biomass of krill on a per-length basis along with associated uncertainty (confidence intervals) derived from net sampling and so may be used to provision size-based ecosystem models with krill biomass.},

Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang’s index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03%). High accuracy and precision between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop age-based stock assessment models for krill. Archival samples preserved in formalin (5%) and stored in ambient conditions were also readable.

These changes, in turn, affect krill occurrence, physiology and behaviour, which could have ecosystem impacts. In this Review, we examine climate change impacts on Antarctic krill and the potential implications for the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Since the 1970s, there have been apparent reductions in adult population density and the occurrence of very dense swarms in the northern Southwest Atlantic. These changes were associated with latitudinal and longitudinal rearrangement of population distribution — including a poleward contraction in the Southwest Atlantic — and were likely driven by ocean warming, sea-ice reductions and changes in the quality of larval habitats. As swarms are targeted by fishers and predators, this contraction could increase fishery–predator interactions, potentially exacerbating risk to already declining penguin populations and recovering whale populations. These risks require urgent mitigation measures to be developed. A circumpolar monitoring network using emerging technologies is needed to augment existing surveys and better record the shifts in krill distribution.},

A krill feedback management programme is currently being developed, and as part of this development, the utility of data-derived indices describing population level processes is being assessed. To date, however, little work has been carried out on the selection of optimum recruitment indices and it has not been possible to assess the performance of length-based recruitment indices across a range of recruitment variability. Neither has there been an assessment of uncertainty in the relationship between an index and the actual level of recruitment. Thus, until now, it has not been possible to take into account recruitment index uncertainty in krill stock management or when investigating relationships between recruitment and environmental drivers. Using length-frequency samples from a simulated population - where recruitment is known - The performance of six potential lengthbased recruitment indices is assessed, by exploring the index-to-recruitment relationship under increasing levels of recruitment variability (from ¡10{\%} to ¡100{\%} around a mean annual recruitment). The annual minimum of the proportion of individuals smaller than 40 mm (F40 min, {\%}) was selected because it had the most robust index-to-recruitment relationship across differing levels of recruitment variability. The relationship was curvilinear and best described by a power law. Model uncertainty was described using the 95{\%} prediction intervals, which were used to calculate coverage probabilities and assess model performance. Despite being the optimum recruitment index, the performance of F40 min degraded under high (.50{\%}) recruitment variability. Due to the persistence of cohorts in the population over several years, the inclusion of F40 min values from preceding years in the relationship used to estimate recruitment in a given year improved its accuracy (mean bias reduction of 8.3{\%} when including three F40 min values under a recruitment variability of 60{\%}).},

abstract = {Stock status for many medium- and small-scale fisheries is unknown due, for example, to a lack of catch data and the absence of scientific observer programs. However, length-frequency data are often available for such fisheries because they are the cheapest and easiest data to obtain. Various stock assessment methods have been developed that use length-frequency data and make equilibrium assumptions regarding both recruitment and fishing mortality. These assumptions raise questions regarding the reliability of the results, particularly when the method is applied to a single sample of length-frequency. We developed a Length-Based Pseudo-cohort Analysis (LBPA) model whose parameters can be estimated using multiple length frequencies and penalized maximum likelihood, under the assumption that using more than one length-frequency sample reduces the effects of the equilibrium conditions assumed in the model. We explored the performance of LBPA using simulations that examined the implications for estimation of the spawning potential rate (SPR) and the relative fishing mortality (F/FMSY). These simulations considered scenarios related to exploitation rate, steepness, numbers of years and sample sizes for length-frequency, and data weights. The performance of LBPA was compared to that of length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR). LBPA performed better with additional length-frequencies than with increased sample size, irrespective of how the data were weighted, and generally outperformed LBSPR. Estimates were more accurate and less biased when exploitation rates were high. This work provides guidelines that should be considered when using length-based pseudo-cohort models for data-poor fisheries.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (hereafter 'krill') occur in regions undergoing rapid environmental change, particularly loss of winter sea ice. During recent years, harvesting of krill has in - creased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic ecosystems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have positive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the population parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic eco - systems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the responsiveness of the ecosystem-based management ap - proach adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better un - derstanding of the resilience and the genetic plasticity of krill life stages, and a quantitative understanding of under-ice and benthic habitat use. Current precautionary management measures of CCAMLR should be maintained until a better understanding of these processes has been achieved. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-$\alpha$ (chl-$\alpha$) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Ad{\'{e}}lie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Climate change alters the extent and structure of sea-ice environments, which affects how they function as a habitat for polar species. Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population.},

We used data from a 4 yr winter study of krill con-dition (lipid content), diet (stable isotopes and fatty acids), and length distributions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula to examine relationships among environmental variables (annual sea-ice cover, water column chlorophyll a [chl a], and upper mixed-layer water temperature), the condition and diet of krill, and recruitment success the following year. Diet indicators (lipid content, ?15N, ?13C, and the fatty acid ratios 16:1n-7/18:4n-3 and 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) in postlarvae were consistent among years regardless of seaice cover, suggesting that post-larval krill do not rely on sea-ice resources for overwinter survival. Diet indicators in larvae were more variable and suggest that larvae may feed on sea-ice resources when they are available but can still persist in the water column when they are not. Principal component analysis between environmental variables and diet indicators showed that water-column chl a was the only variable that significantly affected diet, regardless of annual changes in sea-ice cover. Extensive winter ice in one year did not translate into successful recruitment the following year. Krill demonstrate a high degree of flexibility with respect to overwinter habitat and diet, and the degree to which sea ice is important during different times of year and at different life stages may be more complex than previously thought.},

abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077-1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20{\%} per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

One unique feature of the SAM class is that it allows the fishing selectivity to vary over time, and the degree to which it varies is not subjectively assigned, but estimated within the model. Selection may vary over time due to changes in the spatial pattern of the fish stock or fishing fleet, but a direct cause of selectivity change can be changed in fishing technology or other measures that target specific segments of the fish stocks. If the relative catches from fishing fleets which target different age or size classes of a species are changing over time, then the overall selectivity will also change - even if the selectivity within each fleet is fairly constant. A recent extension of the SAM model allows multiple fleets to be defined. It has been applied to two herring stocks to allow more detailed and fleet-specific management options in forecasts. For both stocks, the assessment from the multi-fleet models was consistent with the results from the single-fleet models, which strengthens confidence in the estimated time-varying selectivity for these and other stocks.},

Therefore, when conducting stock assessment alternative, model structures and data sets are commonly considered. The primary diagnostics used to compare models are to examine residuals patterns to check goodness-of-fit and to conduct retrospective analysis to check the stability of estimates. However, residual patterns can be removed by adding more parameters than justified by the data, and retrospective patterns removed by ignoring the data. Therefore, neither alone can be used for validation, which requires assessing whether it is plausible that a system identical to the model generated the data. Therefore, we use hindcasting to estimate prediction skill, a measure of the accuracy of a predicted value unknown by the model relative to its observed value, to explore model misspecification and data conflicts. We compare alternative model structures based on integrated statistical and Bayesian state-space biomass dynamic models using, as an example, Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna. Validation is not a binary process (i.e. pass or fail) but a continuum; therefore, we discuss the use of prediction skill to identify alternative hypotheses, weight ensemble models and agree on reference sets of operating models when conducting Management Strategy Evaluation.},

abstract = {Integrated stock assessments consist of fitting several sources of catch, abundance, and auxiliary biological information to estimate parameters of equations that describe the population dynamics of fish stocks. Stock assessments are subject to uncertainty, and it is a common practice to characterize uncertainty using alternative hypotheses and assumptions within an ensemble of models to develop scientific advice for fisheries management. In this context, there is the need to assign levels of plausibility to each of the combinations of factors that ultimately reflect the uncertainty on different biological and fishery processes. In this study, we describe and apply a model diagnostic to identify trends in process error in recruitment deviation estimates within ensembles of integrated assessment models of tropical tunas. We demonstrate that assessment model ensembles for tropical tunas contain distinct scenarios with significant trends in process error that are overlooked, with the associated implications for fisheries management. Using the Indian Ocean yellowfin as a case study, we found that trends in recruitment deviates are linked to extreme productivity scenarios which strongly diverged in scale from deterministic models fitted without recruitment deviates. This indicates that when recruitment deviates show an increasing trend, these can compensate for the loss of biomass in periods of high catch beyond the surplus production. In these cases, variation in recruitment is not a random process, but rather takes the function of a compensatory, systematic driver in productivity. Significant trends in recruitment were positively correlated with increased standard deviations and auto-correlation coefficient, non-random residual pattern in fits to abundance indices, and particularly poor performance of the Age-Structured Production Model (ASPM) diagnostic. We suggest that trends in recruitment deviates can be caused by misspecification of the biological parameters used as fixed values in integrated assessment models. The process error diagnostic described here can provide a statistical criterion in support for hypotheses and assumptions when using ensembles of models to develop fisheries management advice.},

Both design-based and model-based methodologies have been employed to address this challenge. The Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) provides valuable insights about population indicators. In this study, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of the SPR for Antarctic krill by applying a Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) model to 20 years of fishery-dependent length composition data. Results showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity among fishing strata in the WAP, where Gerlache Strait stratum was consistently lower than the 20\% SPR reference point, compared with Elephant, Bransfield Strait, South West and Joinville strata. Moreover, we demonstrate the sensitivity of LBSPR to changes in growth parameters, such as k and Linf, which are influenced by environmental variables like chlorophyll. Our findings underscore the necessity of incorporating environmental variability into stock assessment models, such as those based on SPR, to accurately assess krill stock conditions. Given the apparent spatial heterogeneity in intrinsic productivity identified through our SPR estimates, we propose using this approach to establish a management procedure based on a control rule for each stratum. This method adjusts the allocation of catch limits in line with the new management strategy of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

A stacked and the standardized anomaly of the nSAT record was constructed to examine the average regional behavior in the AP. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) and changepoint analysis were applied through the stacked nSAT series to highlight significant changes caused by variation in weather and climate. The CUSUM and bootstrapping analysis revealed two statistically significant breaking points during the 1978–2020 period. The first one occurred in the late nineties ending a warming period and making the beginning of a cooling period; the second one may have taken place in the mid-2010s and could mark the end of the warming pause.

abstract = {This paper describes a method for incorporating varying predation pressure in stock assessment that does not require estimation of consumption rates or absolute consumption by predators. The method is applied to assessment of northern shrimp Pandalus borealis, an important forage species in the North Atlantic Ocean and the target of major fisheries. A predation pressure index (PPI) was developed using data collected during resource surveys in Gulf of Maine northern shrimp habitat areas during 1968-2013. Predators were identified based on the percent frequency of occurrence (PFO) of Pandalid shrimp in their diets. The PPI for each year was the weighted sum of the biomass indices of 21 identified predators, where the weights were the time-series average PFO for each predator. The PPI thus reflected the effects of both the biomass of each predator and its importance as a predator of shrimp. The PPI time series was used to scale an assumed average natural mortality rate (M) that replaced a constant M assumption in the stock assessment model. Use of the PPI-scaled M improved the overall fit of the model and reduced a retrospective pattern in the constant M model by nearly 60{\%}. The PPI approach allows time-varying predation to be accounted for in an assessment model without requiring estimates of absolute abundance of predators and their total consumption, quantities which may be unavailable or difficult to estimate accurately.},

abstract = {We present a method to integrate environmental time series into stock assessment models and to test the significance of correlations between population processes and the environmental time series. Parameters that relate the environmental time series to population processes are included in the stock assessment model, and likelihood ratio tests are used to determine if the parameters improve the fit to the data significantly. Two approaches are considered to integrate the environmental relationship. In the environmental model, the population dynamics process (e.g. recruitment) is proportional to the environmental variable, whereas in the environmental model with process error it is proportional to the environmental variable, but the model allows an additional temporal variation (process error) constrained by a log-normal distribution. The methods are tested by using simulation analysis and compared to the traditional method of correlating model estimates with environmental variables outside the estimation procedure. In the traditional method, the estimates of recruitment were provided by a model that allowed the recruitment only to have a temporal variation constrained by a log-normal distribution. We illustrate the methods by applying them to test the statistical significance of the correlation between sea-surface temperature (SST) and recruitment to the snapper (Pagrus auratus) stock in the Hauraki Gulf-Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Simulation analyses indicated that the integrated approach with additional process error is superior to the traditional method of correlating model estimates with environmental variables outside the estimation procedure. The results suggest that, for the snapper stock, recruitment is positively correlated with SST at the time of spawning.},

Our goals were to quantify whether and how assessments incorporated broader system-level considerations, and to explore factors that might contribute to the use of system-level information. Interactions among fishing fleets (technical interactions) were more commonly included than biophysical interactions (species, habitat, climate). Interactions within the physical environment (habitat, climate) were included twice as often as interactions among species (predation). Many assessment reports included ecological interactions only as background or qualitative considerations, rather than incorporating them in the assessment model. Our analyses suggested that ecosystem characteristics are more likely to be included when the species was overfished (stock status), the assessment is conducted at a science centre with a longstanding stomach contents analysis program, and/or the species life history characteristics suggest it is likely to be influenced by the physical environment, habitat, or predation mortality (short-lived species, sessile benthic species, or low trophic-level species). Regional differences in stomach contents analysis programs may limit the inclusion of predation mortality in stock assessments, and more guidance is needed on best practices for the prioritization of when and how biophysical information should be considered. However, our results demonstrate that significant progress has been made to use best available science and data to expand single-species stock assessments, particularly when a broad definition of EBFM is applied.},

abstract = {This review is based on 58 climate-fisheries models published over the last 28 years that describe the impacts of fishery pressure and environmental variability on populations and ecosystems and include basic principles of population dynamics. It points out that the incorporation of environmental factors in fishery models has already been done and is of great importance for future models used in the assessment of marine resources. The work is guided by the questions to what extent have these models a) enhanced our understanding of the interrelationships between the environment, the fishery and the state of the exploited resources and b) helped to improve the prediction of population dynamics and the assessment of marine resources. For each of the six most commonly used model categories a case study is critically analyzed. The problems of 'breaking relationships' between environmental factors and the biological response used in models, the trade-off between model complexity (realism) and simplicity (data availability) and the potential of multivariate climate indices for forecasting ecosystem states and for use as proxies for combined models are discussed, as are novel non-linear and spatially explicit modeling approaches. Approaches differ in terms of model complexity, use of linear or non-linear equations, number of parameters, forecast time horizon and type of resource modelled. A majority of the models were constructed for fish and invertebrate stocks of the northeast Pacific and the epicontinental seas of the Atlantic, reflecting the advancement of fisheries science in these regions. New, in parts highly complex models and sophisticated approaches were identified. The reviewed studies demonstrate that the performance of fished stocks can better be described if environmental or climatic variability is incorporated into the fisheries models. We conclude that due to the already available knowledge, the greatly enhanced computer power, new methods and recent findings of large-scale climatic/oceanographic cycles, fisheries modeling should progress greatly in the coming years. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract = {Multi-species statistical catch at age models (MSCAA) can quantify interacting effects of climate and fisheries harvest on species populations, and evaluate management trade-offs for fisheries that target several species in a food web. We modified an existing MSCAA model to include temperature-specific growth and predation rates and applied the modified model to three fish species, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), from the eastern Bering Sea (USA). We fit the model to data from 1979 through 2012, with and without trophic interactions and temperature effects, and use projections to derive single- and multi-species biological reference points (BRP and MBRP, respectively) for fisheries management. The multi-species model achieved a higher over-all goodness of fit to the data (i.e. lower negative log-likelihood) for pollock and Pacific cod. Variability from water temperature typically resulted in 5–15{\%} changes in spawning, survey, and total biomasses, but did not strongly impact recruitment estimates or mortality. Despite this, inclusion of temperature in projections did have a strong effect on BRPs, including recommended yield, which were higher in single-species models for Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder that included temperature compared to the same models without temperature effects. While the temperature-driven multi-species model resulted in higher yield MBPRs for arrowtooth flounder than the same model without temperature, we did not observe the same patterns in multi-species models for pollock and Pacific cod, where variability between harvest scenarios and predation greatly exceeded temperature-driven variability in yield MBRPs. Annual predation on juvenile pollock (primarily cannibalism) in the multi-species model was 2–5 times the annual harvest of adult fish in the system, thus predation represents a strong control on population dynamics that exceeds temperature-driven changes to growth and is attenuated through harvest-driven reductions in predator populations. Additionally, although we observed differences in spawning biomasses at the accepted biological catch (ABC) proxy between harvest scenarios and single- and multi-species models, discrepancies in spawning stock biomass estimates did not translate to large differences in yield. We found that multi-species models produced higher estimates of combined yield for aggregate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) targets than single species models, but were more conservative than single-species models when individual MSY targets were used, with the exception of scenarios where minimum biomass thresholds were imposed. Collectively our results suggest that climate and trophic drivers can interact to affect MBRPs, but for prey species with high predation rates, trophic- and management-driven changes may exceed direct effects of temperature on growth and predation. Additionally, MBRPs are not inherently more conservative than single-species BRPs. This framework provides a basis for the application of MSCAA models for tactical ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions under changing climate conditions.},

@article{Haltuch2009,
abstract = {There is strong evidence that low frequency between-year environmental variability, in addition to fishing, is able to affect fish population abundance via recruitment. However, scientific advice regarding catch limits is often based on control rules that depend on the estimation of biomass reference points which typically do not explicitly consider the effects of trends over time in reference points caused by environmental variability. Harvest rates based on commonly used biological reference points such as the level of unfished spawning biomass (B0), the current size of the stock in relation to B0, and BMSY that are sustainable under current environmental conditions may be unsustainable under different environmental conditions. Although several methods exist for estimating biomass reference points, it is unclear which of these are most robust to the effects of long term, low frequency environmental variability. Therefore, simulation is used to evaluate alternative estimators, which differ in terms of how the stock-recruitment relationship is modeled, and whether explicit estimators or proxies are used for B0, the steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship, and current spawning biomass relative to B0. The simulations consider three life histories: a long-lived unproductive rockfish, a moderately long-lived and productive flatfish, and a moderately long-lived and productive hake with highly variable recruitment. Results indicate that in the presence of low frequency autocorrelated forcing of recruitment, biomass reference points should be based on average recruitment and/or dynamic B0 if catch and survey data are available for at least one full period of the environmental variable. In contrast, previous analysis suggests that in the absence of autocorrelated environmental forcing of recruitment, and if the available catch and survey data do not span at least, in this case, 50 years which is one full period of the environmental variable, biomass reference points should be based on the fit of the stock-recruitment relationship. Life history affects the estimability of biomass reference points, which are more difficult to estimate for species with more rapid dynamics such as hake. The method used to calculate the reference points given the results of a stock assessment has a larger effect on estimability than the configuration of the stock assessment method, for the three stock assessment model configurations investigated in this study.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key part of the food web in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Significant inter-annual fluctuations in population dynamics make stock assessment and management of its population a significant challenge. To better understand the population dynamics and fluctuation of krill, a survey-based age-structured catch-at-length model (ACL) is used to estimate the periodic fluctuations, based on length data collected from scientific surveys under the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program between 1992 and 2011. Spectral analysis of the model estimates revealed periodic fluctuations of 5–6 years in the recruitment, total abundance, and total biomass of krill in the Antarctic Peninsula, while spawning stock biomass exhibited periodic fluctuations of both 5–6 years and 2–3 years. The variations in krill total abundance and total biomass were mainly driven by recruitment, but the variation in spawning stock biomass was likely driven by both recruitment and time-varying, age-specific mortality. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of the periodic dynamics of Antarctic krill, which may help lead to improved assessments and fishery management for this important stock.},

abstract = {When assessing the status of a fish population for advising management, the spawner-recruit (S-R) relationship, which represents stock productivity, is an important biological process to consider, including the extent to which environmental drivers should be explicitly accounted for in recruitment estimation. Fishery managers are increasingly making requests for analysts to investigate the utility of including environmental data in stock assessment applications. Consequently, research is needed that addresses both specific environmental processes that may influence stock parameters and robust methods for including such data in the assessment. Two methods for incorporating environmental information in an integrated assessment model were evaluated in this study, based on: 1) including an environmental covariate as an additional component of the S-R function; or 2) using the covariate outside the S-R relationship as a survey index of recruitment. The methods were implemented in a broadly employed stock assessment software package (Stock Synthesis) using population/fishery processes generally applicable to an exploited small pelagic fish species (Pacific sardine). Simulation analysis was used to examine how environment-recruitment considerations in the assessment influenced model performance. The quality (bias and precision) of estimates of abundance and derived quantities generated from the models were examined statistically. Findings indicated that both methods for including an environmental index in the model resulted in relatively high quality estimates for a diverse group of output variables, depending on assumptions regarding bias correction and penalties associated with the recruitment deviation estimates. Several estimated quantities were found to be generally unbiased and relatively precise (e.g., stock biomass and average recruitment), regardless of the method implemented in the model; whereas, the choice of the method did impact the quality of results associated with more sensitive quantities (e.g., virgin recruitment and depletion). Recommendations for approaches based on both methods, as well as practical considerations associated with the methods are discussed.},

abstract = {An age-structured assessment programme (ASAP) that explicitly incorporates predation mortality was applied to Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Northwest Atlantic. Predatory removals were modelled in the same manner as fishing mortality, with a comparable set of time-series, to produce estimates of predation mortality at age and for each year. Results from the analysis showed that incorporating predation into a mackerel stock assessment model notably altered model outputs. When excluding explicitly modelled rates of predation, the model underestimated the magnitude and uncertainty in spawning-stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment. Further, the rates of predation mortality varied across time and were higher for younger fish. Predation mortality was higher than fishing mortality for fish aged 1 year, approximately equal for 2-year-olds, and lower for older fish (3 years and older). Biological reference points for Atlantic mackerel differed considerably when predation mortality was included. For example, SSBMSY was more than twice as high in the model where predation was incorporated than in the fisheries-only model. Although there are several caveats to the predation model outputs, chief of which is that the estimates are conservative because some mackerel predators were excluded, the results demonstrate the feasibility of executing such an approach with an extant tool. The approach presented here ultimately has the advantage of detecting, and upon detection parsing out, the impact of predators relative to fisheries and has the potential to provide useful information to those interested in small pelagic fish and their associated fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Here we describe the findings of an expedition to the northern and eastern sides of the Antarctic Peninsula—a region at the nexus of two proposed Marine Protected Areas—to investigate the distribution and abundance of penguins in this region. We discovered several previously undocumented penguin colonies, completed direct surveys of three colonies initially discovered in satellite imagery, and re-surveyed several colonies last surveyed more than a decade ago. Whereas our expectation had been that the Peninsula itself would divide the areas undergoing ecological transition and the apparently more stable Weddell Sea region, our findings suggest that the actual transition zone lies in the so-called "Ad{\'{e}}lie gap," a 400-km stretch of coastline in which Ad{\'{e}}lies are notably absent. Our findings suggest that the region north and east of this gap represents a distinct ecoregion whose dynamics stand in sharp contrast to surrounding areas and is likely to be impacted by future conservation measures.},

Using a model-based approach applied to concurrently collected data on baleen whale abundance and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) biomass in the South Sandwich Islands (SSI) region, we explore ecological interactions between these taxa. Krill biomass and baleen whale density were highest to the north and northeast of the SSI, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is deflected around the island chain. Humpback whale density was elevated at locations of krill biomass density {\textgreater}150 gm-2. Krill consumption by baleen whales was estimated at 19–29{\%} of the available krill standing stock. We used historic whaling data to confirm the plausibility of these consumption rates and found evidence of rapid weight gain in humpback whales, such that blubber depleted during the breeding season could be restored in a much shorter period than previously assumed. Little is known about krill replenishment rates in the flow of the ACC, or about niche separation between recovering baleen whale populations; both factors may affect species carrying capacities and further monitoring will be required to inform the management of human activities in the region.},

We assessed the extent to which unseen fishing vessel activity due to AIS gaps obscured estimates of overlap between fishing vessel activity and 14 marine predators including sharks, tunas, mammals, seabirds, and critically endangered leatherback turtles. Among vessels equipped with AIS in the northeast Pacific, up to 24{\%} of total predator overlap with fishing vessel activity was unseen, and up to 36{\%} was unseen for some individual species. Waters near 10°N had high unseen overlap with sharks yet low reported shark catch, revealing potential discrepancies in self-reported datasets.

abstract = {Among large cetaceans in the Southern Hemisphere, fin whales were the most heavily exploited in terms of numbers taken during the period of intense industrial whaling. Recent studies suggest that, whilst some humpback whale populations in the Southern Hemisphere appears to have almost completely recovered to their estimated pre-whaling abundance, much less is known about the status of Southern Hemisphere fin whales. Circumpolar estimates in the 1990s suggest an abundance of about 5500 animals south of 60° S, while the IDCR/SOWER-2000 survey for the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula areas estimated 4670 fin whales within this region in the year 2000. More recent studies in smaller regions indicate higher densities, suggesting that previous estimates are overly conservative and/or that fin whales are undergoing a substantial increase. Here we report findings from a recent multi-vessel single-platform sightings survey carried out as part of the 2019 Area 48 Survey for Antarctic krill. While fin whales were encountered throughout the entire survey area, which covered the majority of CCAMLR Management Area 48, they were particularly abundant around the South Orkney Islands and the eastern Bransfield Strait. Large feeding aggregations were also encountered within the central Scotia Sea between South Orkney Islands and South Georgia. Distance sampling analyses suggest an average fin whale density throughout the Scotia Sea of 0.0256 (CV=0.149) whales per km2, which agrees well with recent density estimates reported from smaller sub-regions within the Scotia Sea. Design-based distance sampling analyses resulted in an estimated total fin whale abundance of 53,873 (CV=0.15, 95{\%} CI 40,233–72,138), while a density surface model resulted in a slightly lower estimate of 50,837 (CV: 0.136, 95{\%} CI 38,966–66,324). These estimates are at least an order of magnitude greater than the previous estimate from the same region based on the IDCR/SOWER-2000 data, suggesting that fin whales are undergoing a substantial abundance increase in the South Atlantic. This may have important implications for the assessment of cetacean population trends, but also for CCAMLRs spatial overlap analysis process and efforts to implement a Feedback Management system for Antarctic krill. Our abundance estimate suggests an annual summer krill consumption by fin whales in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea area of 7.97 (95{\%} CI 4.94–11.91) million tonnes, which would represent around 20 times the total krill catch taken by the commercial fishery in Area 48 in the same season, or about 12.7{\%} of the 2019 summer krill standing stock estimated from data collected during the same survey. This highlights the crucial importance of including cetacean krill predators in assessment and management efforts for living marine resources in the Southern Ocean, and particularly stresses the urgent need for a re-appraisal of abundance, distribution and ecological role of Southern Hemisphere fin whales.},

A preliminary quantitative study using questionnaires and interviews was done to gain an initial understanding of the E-Commerce status quo in Tanzania. The main study was qualitative in nature and used interviews with 33 Tanzanian SMEs as the data collection method. A phased approach was adopted in the data analysis stage – firstly thematic analysis was used to report on SME owner's experiences and meanings, whilst examining the ways in which these experiences and meanings come about. Secondly, the theory of communicative action was used as a complementary analytical approach to analyse possible distorted communications by SME agents. Finally structuration theory was employed as a lens to interpret the findings. While it is true that E-Commerce creates opportunities for Tanzanian SMEs to be effectively involved in global markets, findings in this study show that SME owners for the most part view E-Commerce as merely having a static web presence that acts as a marketing instrument of the organisation, coupled with the significant use of the mobile device. SME owners frequently used mobile technology, as they drew upon their understandingunderstanding of mobile technology's ability to offer transactive capability, mobility and University of Cape Town communication. They engaged in limited use of websites as they drew upon their understanding of websites as being incompatible with Tanzanian socio-cultural beliefs. Websites were nevertheless perceived as a platform from which they could continue to build a sophisticated image and advertise/market their products. A problem-solving practice with foreign partners was also enacted through social networking websites, with the purpose of mitigating most of the local web based E-Commerce challenges. The study has several recommendations for example: the deployment of an effective E-Commerce policy specifically tailored around both traditional and mobile E-Commerce; and feasible on-going partnership programmes between government, education institutions and the iv private sector in addressing human resource challenges and social ills such as graduate's lack of business ethics.

abstract = {The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a key species in Antarctic waters, mainly because it is a major component of the diet of dominant predators, including penguins. It is also a marine living resource that is commercially harvested. Since 2000, krill fishing has become more concentrated. On the basis of several years of data, it has been reported that up to 57{\%} of the krill fishery harvests occur in the Bransfield Strait area. The distribution of krill in the Southern Ocean is not well described. Studies that compare the size of krill caught by commercial vessels with that recorded in the diet of predators are even rarer. The main objectives of this study were to assess the spatial diversity in the size and putative age of krill in the CCAMLR subarea 48.1, to investigate the spatial availability of krill and its size and age structure, and to assess whether the diet of Pygoscelis penguins reflects the size structure of krill present in the environment. The results implied that the size and age structure of the krill population were similar throughout the Bransfield Strait during the study period, although those in the eastern and southern parts of the strait and the Brabant Island region were the most similar. The Livingston Island and Drake Passage areas were clearly distinguishable from the above regions, where larger and therefore older krill were recorded. All Pygoscelis penguin species showed size preferences for consumed krill; therefore, their diet is likely not a reliable indicator of the size of krill in the environment. Krill that had not yet reached sexual maturity, and thus not yet started reproducing were commercially caught in the Bransfield Strait during the investigated years.},

abstract = {Mitigating direct and indirect interactions between marine predators and fisheries is a motivating factor for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), especially where predators and fisheries compete for a shared resource. One difficulty in advancing EBFM is parameterizing clear functional responses of predators to indices of prey availability. Alternative characterizations of fishery-predator interactions may therefore benefit the implementation of EBFM. Telemetry data identify foraging areas used by predators and, therefore, represent critical information to mitigate potential competition between predators and fisheries. We analyzed six years (2009±2014) of telemetry data collected at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island and Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, on three species of Pygoscelid penguins and female Antarctic fur seals. In this region, all four species are primarily dependent on Antarctic krill. The tracking data demonstrate local movements near breeding colonies during the austral summer and dispersal from breeding colonies during the winter. We then assessed overlap between predators and the Antarctic krill fishery on a suite of spatiotemporal scales to examine how different data aggregations affect the extent and location of overlap. Concurrent overlap was observed on all spatiotemporal scales considered throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region, including near tagging locations and in distant areas where recent fishing activity has concentrated. Overlap occurred at depths where mean krill densities were relatively high. Our results demonstrate that direct overlap of krill-dependent predators with the krill fishery on small spatiotemporal scales is relatively common throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region. As the krill fishery continues to develop and efforts to implement ecosystem-based management mature, indices of overlap may provide a useful metric for indicating where the risks of fishing are highest. A precautionary approach to allocating krill catches in space would be to avoid large increases in catch where overlap on small spatiotemporal scales is common.},

abstract = {Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breed at a number of sites at the West Antarctic Peninsula, including Goudier Island, Port Lockroy—the longest studied location for tourist-penguin interactions in the Antarctic. These penguins annually encounter some of the highest numbers of tourists in the whole of Antarctica. Using yearly count data from all ten colonies on Goudier Island, we report changes in long-term population size and breeding success over a 21 year period (1996/1997 to 2016/2017), documenting inter-annual variability in numbers of breeding pairs and chicks fledged (productivity). We found a 24.5{\%} (1.4{\%} per annum) decrease in breeding pairs; similar declines were evident in breeding pairs at six colonies visited by tourists as well as at four unvisited colonies. Breeding success also declined, with chick numbers declining in visited (53.7{\%}, 3.8{\%} per annum) and unvisited colonies (59.8{\%}, 4.6{\%} per annum). While gentoo penguin numbers are increasing regionally, we reveal a recent decline in the Goudier Island population occurring simultaneous with increases in tourist numbers from 262 in 1996/1997 to 19,688 in 2016/2017. Analyses suggest a complex situation with different possible drivers of change. There was a significant negative effect of increasing air temperature and shifts in sea ice variables on breeding pairs. However, similar statistical support showed a significant link existed between year and visitors, with higher numbers of visitors negatively affecting penguin numbers. Based on our results we recommend increased precaution in management at Goudier Island, and initiation of similar studies at other frequently visited penguin sites in Antarctica.},

abstract = {The west Antarctic Peninsula is an important breeding and foraging location for marine predators that consume Antarctic Krill (Euphasia superba). It is also an important focus for the commercial fishery for Antarctic krill, managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Aiming to minimise ecosystem risks from fishing, whilst enabling a sustainable fishery, CCAMLR has recently endorsed a new management framework that incorporates information about krill biomass estimates, sustainable harvest rates and a risk assessment to spatially and temporally distribute catch limits. We have applied a risk assessment framework to the west Antarctic Peninsula region (Subarea 48.1), with the aim of identifying the most appropriate management units by which to spatially and temporally distribute the local krill catch limit. We use the best data currently available for implementing the approach, recognising the framework is flexible and can accommodate new data, when available, to improve future estimates of risk. We evaluated 36 catch distribution scenarios for managing the fishery and provide advice about the scale at which the krill fishery can be managed. We show that the spatial distribution with which the fishery currently operates presents some of the highest risks of all scenarios evaluated. We highlight important issues that should be resolved, including data gaps, uncertainty and incorporating ecosystem dynamics. We emphasize that for the risk assessment to provide robust estimates of risk, it is important that the management units are at a similar scale to ecosystem function. Managing the fishery at small scales has the lowest risk but may necessitate a high level of management interaction. Our results offer advice to CCAMLR about near-term management and this approach could provide a template for the rest of the southwest Atlantic (Area 48), or fisheries elsewhere. As each data layer influences the outcome of the risk assessment, we recommend that updated estimates of the distribution, abundance and consumption of krill, and estimates of available krill biomass will be key as CCAMLR moves forward to develop a longer-term management strategy.},

abstract = {Information about stakeholder aspirations is a fundamental requirement for ecosystem-based management, but the detail is often elusive, and debates may focus on simplistic opposing positions. This is exemplified by the Antarctic krill fishery, which, despite a current operational catch limit equivalent to just 1{\%} of the estimated biomass and actual annual catches much lower than this, is the subject of a high-profile debate framed around ambiguous concepts such as sustainability. Q methodology was applied to explore the detailed views of representatives of three stakeholder sectors (the fishing industry, conservation-focused non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and scientists from seven countries involved in research on the krill-based ecosystem). The analysis distinguished two clear groupings, one of which included the views of all NGO participants while the other included the views of fishing industry participants and a subset of the scientists. Key differences between the groups included the priority given to different management measures, and to continued commercial fishing. However, the results also revealed considerable overlap between viewpoints. Both groups prioritised the maintenance of ecosystem health and recognised the importance of defining management objectives. Also, neither group prioritised a decrease in catch limits. This suggests that most participants in the study agree that management should improve but do not perceive a major problem in the ecosystem's ability to support current catch levels. Cooperation to identify shared management objectives based on stakeholder aspirations for the ecosystem might enhance progress, whereas polarised discussions about preferred management measures or ambiguous concepts are likely to impede progress.},

abstract = {The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) establishes the regulatory framework for fisheries management and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the Southern Ocean. Identifying foraging areas regularly used by penguins provides valuable information for the small-scale management of the krill fishery and the design of MPAs, currently under discussion in CCAMLR. We used geolocators to identify the areas used by Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins from Ardley Island (South Shetlands Islands) during the non-breeding season and Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) ($\delta$13 C and $\delta$15 N) on feathers to study the trophic niche. Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins depended on resources available in CCAMLR subareas 48.1 and 48.5 during the post-breeding and molting stage, the subarea 48.5 during the post-molting stage and subareas 48.1, 48.2 and 48.5 during the pre-breeding stage, critical moments of the species' annual cycle. The Domain 1, Weddell Sea and SOISS MPA proposal areas were extensively used. SIA results show the use of coastal and off-shore foraging areas in 2022, but principally off-shore areas in 2021. Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins dependence on resources from different subareas in different times of the year emphasizes the need of incorporating the temporal dimension of resources utilization when designing conservation measures in the Southern Ocean. With an increasing pressure on Ad{\'{e}}lie penguin colonies in the western Antarctic Peninsula, its long-term protection might depend on both 1) well designed and managed MPAs in the Domain 1 and the Weddell Sea, and 2) small-scale fisheries management that simultaneously consider activities undertaken in different small-scale management units.},

The first section provides the background to CCAMLR, including the formulation of the convention and its objectives, its operation, and the historical trends in fisheries. Later sections describe (i) the reasons why a precautionary approach to setting catch limits evolved, (ii) how the precautionary approach takes account of ecosystem objectives and provides for the orderly development of new fisheries, and (iii) how the use of ecosystem indicators in the setting of catch limits and for monitoring the effects of fishing is being evaluated. The final section describes the general framework being used to develop a feedback-management system that incorporates objectives, target species assessments and ecosystem assessments. The CCAMLR experience provides two important lessons. First, conservation objectives can only be achieved by implementing management measures, even when very little is known. Second, methods were found for achieving scientific consensus despite the uncertainties surrounding estimates of parameters and the behaviour of the system. CCAMLR is yet to face the real test in its ecosystem approach, the development of the krill fishery. Before this occurs, appropriate management procedures have to be developed to avoid localized effects on the ecosystem and to provide effective feedbacks on the effects of fishing through its monitoring programme.

abstract = {The ecosystem approach to fisheries has been discussed since the 1980s. It aims to reduce risks from fisheries to whole, or components of, ecosystems, not just to target species. Precautionary approaches further aim to keep the risk of damage to a low level. Here, we provide a dynamic framework for spreading the ecosystems risk of fisheries in space and time, a method that can be used from the outset of developing fisheries and continually updated as new knowledge becomes available. Importantly, this method integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess risk and provides mechanisms to both spread the risk, including enabling closed areas to help offset risk, and adjust catch limits to keep regional risk to a baseline level. Also, the framework does not require uniform data standards across a region but can incorporate spatially and temporally heterogeneous data and knowledge. The approach can be coupled with the conservation of biodiversity in marine protected areas, addressing potential overlap of fisheries with areas of high conservation value. It accounts for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ecosystems, including the different spatial and temporal scales at which organisms function. We develop the framework in the first section of the paper, including a simple illustration of its application. In the framework we include methods for using closed areas to offset risk or for conserving biodiversity of high conservation value. We also present methods that could be used to account for uncertainties in input data and knowledge. In the second section, we present a real-world illustration of the application of the framework to managing risks of food web effects of fishing for Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean. Last, we comment on the wider application and development of the framework as information improves.},

abstract = {The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is widely recognized as a leading international organization in developing best practice in the ecosystem approach to managing fisheries. CCAMLR provides a useful case study for examining the impediments to implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) because it has EBFM principles embedded within its convention rather than having to make a transition from single-species management to an ecosystem approach. CCAMLR is demonstrating that (i) EBFM does not need to equate to complexity in management and (ii) methods can be developed to decide on spatial management strategies for fisheries so that predators of target species are not disproportionately affected as a result of spatial and/or temporal dependencies of predators on their prey. Science has an important role in implementing EBFM, not only in measuring and assessing the status of target species and their predators but also in designing cost-effective management strategies and in resolving disputes. Importantly, attention needs to be given to developing the capability and tools to overcome differences amongst scientists in providing advice to managers. The CCAMLR experience suggests that, without adequate safeguards, voluntary participation by fishing States in CCAMLR and its consensus environment do not provide strong foundations for achieving, in the long term, the ecosystem-based principles for managing fisheries when there is any degree of scientific uncertainty. Some solutions to these issues are discussed. Overall, broader-than-CCAMLR solutions amongst the international community as well as the continued commitment of CCAMLR Members will be required to resolve these issues. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The objective of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is to sustain healthy marine ecosystems and the fisheries they support. One of the earliest implementations was in the Southern Ocean, where decision rules and stock reference points were developed for managing the Antarctic krill fishery, together with an ecosystem-monitoring programme intended to aid management decisions. This latter component has not been incorporated directly into management, so here, we consider variability in the krill fishery at South Georgia, relating it to physical and biological monitoring indices, finding sea surface temperature to be a key correlate with both annual catch and long-term biological indices. Some indices from krill predators showed significant positive relationships with krill harvesting in the preceding winter, presumably indicative of the importance of winter foraging conditions. We explore how ecological structure affects results, examining two monitoring sites 100 km apart. Results suggest different biological conditions at the two sites, probably reflecting different scales of ecosystem operation, emphasizing that an appreciation of scale will enhance krill fishery management. Finally, in reviewing different drivers of ecological change, we identify important additional monitoring that would help better reflect ecosystem status, improve the utility of CEMP, providing information necessary for the ecosystem approach at South Georgia.},

abstract = {The Scotia Sea ecosystem is a major component of the circumpolar Southern Ocean system, where productivity and predator demand for prey are high. The eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence dominate the physics of the Scotia Sea, leading to a strong advective flow, intense eddy activity and mixing. There is also strong seasonality, manifest by the changing irradiance and sea ice cover, which leads to shorter summers in the south. Summer phytoplankton blooms, which at times can cover an area of more than 0.5 million km 2 , probably result from the mixing of micronutrients into surface waters through the flow of the ACC over the Scotia Arc. This production is consumed by a range of species including Antarctic krill, which are the major prey item of large seabird and marine mammal populations. The flow of the ACC is steered north by the Scotia Arc, pushing polar water to lower latitudes, carrying with it krill during spring and summer, which subsidize food webs around South Georgia and the northern Scotia Arc. There is also marked interannual variability in winter sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures that is linked to southern hemisphere-scale climate processes such as the El Ni{\~{n}} o-Southern Oscillation. This variation affects regional primary and secondary production and influences biogeochemical cycles. It also affects krill population dynamics and dispersal, which in turn impacts higher trophic level predator foraging, breeding performance and population dynamics. The ecosystem has also been highly perturbed as a result of harvesting over the last two centuries and significant ecological changes have also occurred in response to rapid regional warming during the second half of the twentieth century. This combination of historical perturbation and rapid regional change highlights that the Scotia Sea ecosystem is likely to show significant change over the next two to three decades, which may result in major ecological shifts.},

abstract = {In the last decades, changing climate conditions have had a severe impact on sea ice at the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), an area rapidly transforming under global warming. To study the development of spring sea ice and environmental conditions in the pre-satellite era we investigated three short marine sediment cores for their biomarker inventory with a particular focus on the sea ice proxy IPSO25 and micropaleontological proxies. The core sites are located in the Bransfield Strait in shelf to deep basin areas characterized by a complex oceanographic frontal system, coastal influence and sensitivity to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. We analyzed geochemical bulk parameters, biomarkers (highly branched isoprenoids, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, sterols), and diatom abundances and diversity over the past 240 years and compared them to observational data, sedimentary and ice core climate archives, and results from numerical models. Based on biomarker results we identified four different environmental units characterized by (A) low sea ice cover and high ocean temperatures, (B) moderate sea ice cover with decreasing ocean temperatures, (C) high but variable sea ice cover during intervals of lower ocean temperatures, and (D) extended sea ice cover coincident with a rapid ocean warming. While IPSO25 concentrations correspond quite well to satellite sea ice observations for the past 40 years, we note discrepancies between the biomarker-based sea ice estimates, the long-term model output for the past 240 years, ice core records, and reconstructed atmospheric circulation patterns such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM). We propose that the sea ice biomarker proxies IPSO25 and PIPSO25 are not linearly related to sea ice cover, and, additionally, each core site reflects specific local environmental conditions. High IPSO25 and PIPSO25 values may not be directly interpreted as referring to high spring sea ice cover because variable sea ice conditions and enhanced nutrient supply may affect the production of both the sea-ice-associated and phytoplankton-derived (open marine, pelagic) biomarker lipids. For future interpretations we recommend carefully considering individual biomarker records to distinguish between cold sea-ice-favoring and warm seaice- diminishing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The appetite for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approaches has grown, but the perception persists that implementation is slow. Here, we synthesize progress toward implementing EBFM in the United States through one potential avenue: expanding fish stock assessments to include ecosystem considerations and interactions between species, fleets, and sectors. We reviewed over 200 stock assessments and assessed how the stock assessment reports included information about system influences on the assessed stock. Our goals were to quantify whether and how assessments incorporated broader system-level considerations, and to explore factors that might contribute to the use of system-level information. Interactions among fishing fleets (technical interactions) were more commonly included than biophysical interactions (species, habitat, climate). Interactions within the physical environment (habitat, climate) were included twice as often as interactions among species (predation). Many assessment reports included ecological interactions only as background or qualitative considerations, rather than incorporating them in the assessment model. Our analyses suggested that ecosystem characteristics are more likely to be included when the species was overfished (stock status), the assessment is conducted at a science centre with a longstanding stomach contents analysis program, and/or the species life history characteristics suggest it is likely to be influenced by the physical environment, habitat, or predation mortality (short-lived species, sessile benthic species, or low trophic-level species). Regional differences in stomach contents analysis programs may limit the inclusion of predation mortality in stock assessments, and more guidance is needed on best practices for the prioritization of when and how biophysical information should be considered. However, our results demonstrate that significant progress has been made to use best available science and data to expand single-species stock assessments, particularly when a broad definition of EBFM is applied.},

abstract = {Performance evaluation of data-limited, length-based methods is instrumental in determining and quantifying their accuracy under various scenarios and in providing guidance about model applicability and limitations. We conducted a simulation-estimation analysis to compare the performance of four length-based stock assessment methods: length-based Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA), under varying life history, exploitation status, and recruitment error scenarios. Across all scenarios, TB and LBSPR were the most consistent and accurate assessment methods. LBRA is highly biased, but precautionary, and LIME is more suitable for assessments with time-series longer than a year. All methods have difficulties when assessing short-lived species. The methods are less accurate in estimating the degree of recruitment overfishing when the stocks are severely overexploited, and inconsistent in determining growth overfishing when the stocks are underexploited. Increased recruitment error reduces precision but can decrease bias in estimations. This study highlights the importance of quantifying the accuracy of stock assessment methods and testing methods under different scenarios to determine their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance on which methods to employ in various situations.},

abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets' approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

abstract = {The state-space assessment model (SAM) is increasingly used to assess fish stocks in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. One unique feature of the SAM class is that it allows the fishing selectivity to vary over time, and the degree to which it varies is not subjectively assigned, but estimated within the model. Selection may vary over time due to changes in the spatial pattern of the fish stock or fishing fleet, but a direct cause of selectivity change can be changed in fishing technology or other measures that target specific segments of the fish stocks. If the relative catches from fishing fleets which target different age or size classes of a species are changing over time, then the overall selectivity will also change - even if the selectivity within each fleet is fairly constant. A recent extension of the SAM model allows multiple fleets to be defined. It has been applied to two herring stocks to allow more detailed and fleet-specific management options in forecasts. For both stocks, the assessment from the multi-fleet models was consistent with the results from the single-fleet models, which strengthens confidence in the estimated time-varying selectivity for these and other stocks.},

abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077-1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20{\%} per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {It is challenging in fisheries stock assessment to estimate cohort dynamics from length-based data for hard-to-age stocks, and existing approaches, for example, age-structured catch-at-length models (ACL) are unable to account for length-dependent processes within each cohort. Fisheries-dependent data are usually considered the default input to stock assessment models. However, with widespread recognition of the uncertainty of fisheries-dependent data and the increasing availability of high-quality survey data, a new situation emerges in some fisheries where a stock assessment model based only on survey data can provide good estimation of population dynamics. We develop an age- and length-structured statistical catch-at-length model (ALSCL) to estimate age-based dynamics from survey catch-at-length data. This approach also provides a good basis to then integrate fisheries-dependent data in the model. ALSCL can explicitly include length-dependent mortality and growth within each cohort by simultaneously tracking the three-dimensional dynamics across time, age, and length. We first use simulations of yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea, Pleuronectidae) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus Obesus, Scombridae) to demonstrate that ALSCL outperforms ACL by providing more accurate estimates of age-based population dynamics when length-dependent processes are important. Next, we apply ALSCL to estimate the cohort dynamics of female yellowtail flounder on the Grand Bank off Newfoundland using survey catch-at-length, weight-at-length, and maturity-at-length data. We consider ALSCL as a hybrid between ACL and length-structured stock assessment models that keeps the advantages of both, and its ability to simultaneously track age and length dynamics is an important step toward the next-generation of fisheries stock assessment models.},

Biases in estimated mature biomass are demonstrated here when increasing the bin width using a simulation framework based on the Pribilof Islands red king crab (PIRKC) assessment. Several potential sources of bias were explored through simulation. The bias was removed by applying an alternative assessment method which used a finer approximation of the integral representing the probability of a crab molting from one size bin. Trade-offs exist at both sides of the bin width spectrum. Precision and model stability may suffer when bin width is too large; slowed parameter estimation and problems fitting multinomial likelihoods to length frequency data may appear when bin widths are too small. Simulation studies (like the one presented here) are useful for identifying optimal bin width for management related tasks.},

abstract = {Many fisheries in the world are data-moderate, with data types (e.g., total removals, abundance indices, and biological composition data) of varied quality (e.g., limited time series or representative samples) or available data. Integrated stock assessments are useful tools for data-moderate fisheries as they can include all available information, can be updated due to the availability of more information over time, and can directly test the inclusion and exclusion of specific data types. This study uses the simulation testing and systematic data reduction from the US West Coast benchmark assessments to examine the performance of Stock Synthesis with catch and length (SS-CL) compositions only. The simulation testing of various life histories, recruitment variabilities, and data availability scenarios found that the correctly specified SS-CL can estimate unbiased key population quantities such as stock status with as little as 1 year of length data although 5 years or more may be more reliable. The error in key population quantities is decreased with an increase in years and the sample size of length data. The removal of the length compositions from benchmark assessments often caused large model deviations in the outputs compared to the removal of other data sources, indicating the importance of length data in integrated models. Models with catch and length data, excluding abundance indices and age composition, generally provided informative estimates of the stock status relative to the reference model, with most data scenarios falling within the CIs of the reference model. The results of simulation analysis and systematic data reduction indicated that SS-CL is potentially viable for data-moderate assessments in the USA, thus reducing precautionary buffers on catch limits for many stocks previously assessed in a lower tier using catch-only models. SS-CL could also be applied to many stocks around the world, maximizing the use of data available via the well tested, multifeature benefits of SS.},

Among other things, the findings in the Spanish case show a complex relationship between the amount of fish landed and price; a clear substitution relationship between fresh fish and aquaculture; a negative impact oflabour costs in amanual labour-inten- sive sector such as fishing, which in developed countries is being affected by an exodus of manpower to other sectors where there is less uncertainty surrounding labour conditions; the impact ofSpain being barred from international fishing grounds a result ofthe delimitation of exclusive economic zones (EEZs); and the dwindling importance of fisheries traffic as a result of the port devolution process begun in Spain in the early 1990s. Thenon-significance ofa priori key factors, such as the price ofoil andSpain's entry into the EEC, canbe explainedby widespread energy subsidies and contradictions in the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, respectively},

abstract = {Most growth studies have considered the relationship between age and growth. Such relationships are essential to age-structured fishery stock assessments. In contrast, assessments based on stage-structured population dynamics models require information on the probability of animals moving from one stage to each of the other stages at each time-step. Size-structured population dynamics models are a special case of stage-structured population dynamics models in which each class represents a unique set of sizes. These models form the basis of assessments for many valuable, hard to age, marine species, including crabs, abalone, lobsters and prawns. Growth within these models is governed by a size-transition matrix. The values for the parameters of a size-transition matrix can either be estimated externally to the assessment, generally utilizing data from tag-recapture experiments, or the estimation of growth can be integrated within the assessment model. This paper reviews the approaches used to construct size-transition matrices, including the underlying structural formulation, statistical estimation framework, and the consequences of error when specifying these matrices on the ability to estimate population size and manage populations sustainably.},

abstract = {Analysts conducting stock assessments using integrated, age-structured models must discretize length data into a limited number of bins (data bins). Furthermore, some modeling frameworks also allow users to specify a distinct structure for how lengths of fish are represented in the model (model bins). The effect of choices regarding the number and width of these bins on model output is unclear, and these choices are made inconsistently in assessments across regions and species. Here, we used the stock synthesis modeling framework, and the ss3sim stock assessment simulation package, to explore the effects of choices about length discretization on stock assessment performance for three fish life-history types and four data cases. We found that, with all other aspects of a model fixed, increasing the model bin width tended to increase estimates of spawning biomass, but this effect depended on the shape of length-based processes (e.g., growth, maturity, and selectivity). Thus, we suggest analysts using model bins wider than 1 cm explore the effect of this decision on derived management quantities. In the context of estimation, there generally was a predictable tradeoff between estimation accuracy and model run time, with finer model and data bins always improving estimation accuracy and model convergence, but increasing run time. In some cases, wider data bins reduced run time (by up to 50{\%}) with little sacrifice in model estimation performance, particularly those using conditional age-at-length data. This study identifies key aspects to consider when binning length, and provides pertinent information for stock assessment best practice guidelines.},

abstract = {Integrated population dynamics models use a variety of data types, and all the data used impact modeled processes and estimated dynamics. Paired age-length data treated as conditional age-at-length (CAAL) data are increasingly being used as a data component in stock assessment models. The original intent of the use of CAAL data was to directly estimate the length-at-age process, including the associated variability in length-at-age. However, we show that introduction of CAAL data that are not representative of the age-structure of the population can cause bias and imprecision in estimates of not only growth, but also dynamics and management quantities. Estimation of an appropriate age-based observations-modeled process may improve model performance. We also show that even the use of representative CAAL data in a model with misspecified age-based systems-modeled processes (natural mortality and time-varying growth) can lead to bias and imprecision in growth, dynamics, and management quantities. In these cases, estimation of an age-based observations-modeled process magnified the bias and imprecision. Greater consideration of this type of data is needed.},

abstract = {Estimating growth (increase in size with age) is an integral component of fish population assessment. The use of integrated assessment models combined with the influence of misfitting size composition data on results have led to renewed interest in how growth is modeled in the assessment process. The types of data available to describe the growth process control how the length-at-age relationship will be estimated. Many factors contribute to the complexity of estimating length-at-age, including multiple sources of biological variability and difficulties in getting representative samples. The growth process in the population dynamics model is linked to all other processes and data but most directly influences the assessment model through 1) converting numbers into weight and vice versa, 2) productivity, and 3) modifying fits of size composition data. In some cases, an assessment may be insensitive to moderate levels of misspecification of the growth process, and therefore, relatively simple treatments may be adequate. However, in many cases, especially those where the fit of size composition is influential in estimating scale, a more thorough treatment of the growth process is needed. A complete treatment of growth will estimate the most important forms of biological variability, including individual, sex-specific, temporal, and spatial variability. Several types of sampling bias, including selectivity, length-stratified sampling, and spatial and measurement error, will likely also need to be addressed. When sufficient data are available, assessment authors should consider estimating the growth process as part of the integrated assessment model or consider empirical approaches for situations with high biological variability and sampling bias.},

@article{Laslett2004a,
abstract = {A novel two-stage procedure for fitting growth curves to length frequency data collected from commercial fisheries is described. The method is suitable for species in which cohorts are spawned over a limited time period, and samples of length frequency data are collected regularly (e.g. in weekly, fortnightly, or monthly time intervals) over an extended time period. In the first stage of analysis, Gaussian mixtures are fitted separately to the data for each time interval, and summary statistics (component means and standard errors) are extracted. In the second stage, parametric growth models, such as the von Bertalanffy seasonal growth curve, are fitted to the summary data. The error structure in this second stage of analysis incorporates random between-year effects, random within-year age-group effects, random within-year time-interval effects, random within-year age-group and time-interval interactions, and sampling errors. This complex error structure incorporating unbalanced crossed and nested random effects acknowledges that commercial fishing is not an exercise in random sampling, and allows for the inevitable additional sources of random variation in such an enterprise. The method is applied to South Australian southern bluefin tuna length frequency data collected from 1964 to 1989, and leads to the conclusion that juvenile tuna grew faster in the 1980s than in the 1960s, with the 1970s being a decade of highly variable growth. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

I review current practice related to this component in age-structured models, discussing how growth is specified, its functions in the stock assessment model, and how growth-related data are used. I then discuss some associated problems and suggest that (a) we should be cautious about assuming that all fishery selectivities are size-based, and that an age-size sample is always random at size; (b) the jury is still out on the question of whether growth variation by phenotype is a useful model feature; (c) when growth is time-varying, conditional age-at-size data might better used outside the model (as an age-size key); and (d) that it is often difficult to extract much growth information from size composition data. I conclude by presenting a strategy for addressing the structural, procedural, and statistical decisions that must be made in finding the growth model best suited to our data.},

abstract = {Overwinter environmental conditions are a major driver of larval survival, recruitment, and reproductive pre-conditioning in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean.},

abstract = { During austral summer 2018/2019, we deployed an array of six submerged moorings equipped with Nortek Signature100 integrated wideband echosounder and acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) on the continental shelf of the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Acoustic data from these instruments were used to classify targets, estimate water flow and the biomass of Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ), and quantify krill flux (biomass transport). We differentiated krill from other target aggregations using a supervised classification of data from the echosounder representing five wideband frequency bins spanning 68–113 kHz and two narrowband frequencies at 70 and 120 kHz. We estimated krill biomass using echosounder data collected at 120 kHz and water flow using the ADCP data. We estimated the biomass flux from the product of mean volumetric krill density and flow speed over a depth-integration range of 150 m. The overall mean krill areal biomass density based on hourly averages was 174 g⋅m –2 during the austral summer (December–March). Mean daily biomass decreased by an order of magnitude, from 300 to 31 g⋅m –2 , over the sampling period, and fluctuated by nearly a factor of 4 above and below the local trend within weekly intervals. Mean current direction was along-shelf toward the west, and mean flow speed increased from ∼0.10 to 0.14 m⋅s –1 during the season. Krill flux was correlated with biomass variation, and the grand mean flux was 0.13 g⋅m –2 ⋅s –1 . During the study period and in our approximately 1,300 km 2 study area, average total biomass of krill was 116265 metric tons, and total cumulative krill biomass was 2.5 million tons. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrated echosounder-ADCP systems for quantifying krill flux in an important foraging area used by krill-dependent predators (seabirds and marine mammals) that breed nearby and highlight the scales of variability in a key prey resource required by these predators. },
