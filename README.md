# **Stock Assessment in an Implicit Spatial Context: Krill in Subarea 48.1 (Southern Ocean)**  

This repository contains the Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) assessment model for *Euphausia superba* (Antarctic krill) in Subarea 48.1, considering spatial heterogeneity. The project includes multiple files and subdirectories, but the key functions and paths for conducting the assessment can be found at the following link: [SA_Krill Documentation](https://mauromardones.github.io/SA_Krill/).
